# Chickens are Dinosaurs ! 🐓

Little 2D Pixel Platformer game project where you play as a little chicken in the dinosaur's world!  
--- 🐤🦖🦕 ---


## Short description of the project 📝

This project is a **Video-Game** project entirely made by **two people**: the art, the code, musics and sounds etc...  
The goal is mostly to **learn and improve**, we both are **passionate** in the field of computer science and most importantly **video-games development**. This project is a way for us to jump right into something more concrete and just **gain experience** !


## What's the game about 🕹️

During the times where dinosaurs roamed the earth, the **chicken's kingdom** substains peacefully as long as they don't approach carnivores.  
One day, the wise king *'Chicking'* calls all the young chickens to give them a **test** and find the most brave and strong of them all.  
Why ? *Chicking* feels that the **end is near...**  
  
The chosen one has to **find the chicken eggs** that are all around the world to take them and put them to a **safe place**.  
Will you succeed save all the chicken eggs from the disaster *Chicking* feels coming ?  

The adventure in the dinosaur's world won't be easy: running throught the tall jungly grass, jumping near *Tyrannosaurs* and gliding between *Microraptors* will be required to find all those precious eggs ! Funny looking worms will be on the way to feed you and maybe give you some extras...  

Good luck little chick, be brave and don't be a **poule mouillée** !

## Project's evolution

I'll come back here to update every now and then what's new in the project, can be interesting to have a place where the principal changes are graved in stone to see how the project evolutes in time !  
  
> #### 17/08/2023 - Beginning.
> The project started few days ago. For now we have a moving cute chicken and some automaping already done !  
> No date, no deadlines, not even really defined goals are already set. We're living the moment by making the few ideas that pops in our head.  
> We have a general idea of how the game will look like, but nothing defined enough to write about it.
